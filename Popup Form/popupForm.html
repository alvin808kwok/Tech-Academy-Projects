    <p>Just last weekend I was at the beach sitting on the sand with my dog named Jay.
        There was an endangered hawaiian monk seal lying on the beach. Jay started barking at
        the hawaiian monk seal. The hawaiian monk seal was sleeping. We could all hear it
        snooring. But Jay kept barking at the seal. Jay kept barking and barking. The monk seal
        turned over and slept on his back side. Jay then rushed toward the seal continued barking
        and started to scratch the seal. The seal then turned over once more and smash Jay into
        the sand. Jay's whole body was under the seals monk except for his head. I rushed over to
        save my dog. Luckily since I work out a lot, I was able to turn over the 500 pound monk
        and rescue my dog. However, since the hawaiian monk seal is endangered, the lifeguard on
        wrote me a ticket because me and Jay were not supposed to touch the seal. But I fought
        the ticket off in court with my lawyer and did not have to pay a dime.
